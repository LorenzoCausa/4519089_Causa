# simulation assignment of flexible automation course

**Note:** The name of the repository has been chosen so that after a `git clone` the project has already the requested name convention.

## How to run the project
The use of this simulation is immediate, the only requirement is to have CoopeliaSimEdu installed on the machine.
The first thing to do is obviously download the scene file on your PC. If you use the terminal (for example with git bash) 
you can clone the whole repository just by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/LorenzoCausa/4519089_Causa
```
After downloading the scene on your PC you can open it with coppelia.
No further preparation is required to run the simulation. Once the scene is open, you can immediately start the simulation, just check that the
the simulation engine in use is Newton.
